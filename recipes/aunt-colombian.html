    <h3>Skinless chicken thighs can be substituted for chicken thighs with skin.

    </h3>
    <p>I learned this recipe when visiting my Colombian family members in Houston, Texas. The sauce that the chicken cooks in is chock full of flavor. </p>
    <p>Cumin, curry, black pepper, turmeric, pimenton (paprika), and seasoning salt make the chicken's sauce tasty enough to lick your plate! Serve with rice.</p>
